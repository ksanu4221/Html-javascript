// function declarations are moved to the top of their scope (before code execution)
//  temporal dead zone is the period between variable hoiting declaration and variable intialization.
// if we access const ,let in tzd then it will give refrence error
// // if we access var in tdz then it will give undefined
// const names
// var names=undefined
